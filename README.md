Just a small exercise on memroy managment with C in a form of terminal based text editor. Not meant to be a project, not meant to be actually good in terms of design or features. 

A small list of things for me to do first that I might do if I want to: Delete, ENTER (just memmove on lines struct), multiple chars/lines adding,
Undo/Redo functionaliy (possible a new struct that contains a symbol/string, enum with action that been made (delete add), start position where to add/remove (after the action made maybe??). Treat it like a stack, so pop/push maybe.
For redo the same struct but just populates only when Undo is called
